# Identifier Sentence

### A unique error phrase generator and parser. 

The original idea came from a post here: http://blog.asana.com/2011/09/6-sad-squid-snuggle-softly/ and adapted from the 
Java code from here: https://github.com/PerWiklander/IdentifierSentence.

I had written this years ago and recently rediscovered it while logging into my [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) account.
